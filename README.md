# mw2gitit

Convert a mediawiki database dump to gitit format.

## Usage

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```

## History
I have been running a mediawiki instance for a long time. Later, I
found I wanted to switch over to [gitit](http://www.gitit.net) but
without losing everything in the old wiki (but history was less important.)
